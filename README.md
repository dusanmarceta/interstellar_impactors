# Interstellar_impactors

This project focuses on modeling and analyzing the expected orbital elements, radiants, and velocities of interstellar objects that impact Earth. The goal is to generate realistic synthetic populations of interstellar impactors and study their observable characteristics.

## Features

- Generation of synthetic interstellar objects (ISOs)
- Computation of orbital elements at Earth impact
- Determination of radiants and impact velocities
- Tools for statistical analysis and visualization

## Repository Structure



## Requirements

The project uses Python. Typical dependencies include:

- numpy  
- scipy  
- matplotlib  
- pandas  

(Adjust this list depending on your actual code.)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Interstellar_impactors.git
